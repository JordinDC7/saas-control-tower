## 🚀 Building in Public

This repository is part of my journey to become an elite full-stack engineer.

Goals:
- Master Clean Architecture
- Build production-grade SaaS systems
- Share progress transparently
- Ship real software, not tutorials

Daily progress, design decisions, and tradeoffs are documented through commits and updates.
